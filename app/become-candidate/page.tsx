                In order for an individual to make a valid application for permission (also known as
                a visa) under the Skilled Worker and other sponsored work route, a sponsor must
                first assign a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) to them.
                <br />
                <br />
                There are two types of CoS that can be assigned:

                </ul>
                <br />
                <strong>Undefined CoS</strong> are to be used for those who are already in the UK
                and who are lawfully able to apply under the Skilled Worker route; and for those
                applying under the other routes, whether in the UK or overseas. When a sponsor
                initially applies for a licence, it will be asked to confirm how many CoS are
                required and may be asked to provide evidence or a detailed explanation as to why
                the business will need to assign that amount of CoS.

                Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) acts out scenarios which nurses

                separate clinical examination is known as a &apos;station&apos; and candidates will
                visit all the stations within a set time. The test of competence is based on current
                UK pre-registration standards where in applicant nurses are supposed to demonstrate
                safe and effective practice. <br />
                You can begin the OSCE stage of the Overseas registration process once you have
                received a decision letter from the NMC and you have received a visa clearance to
                enter, work and stay in the UK.
